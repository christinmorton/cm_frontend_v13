# Funnel Framework

A reusable decision-guided sales funnel system

---

## 1. Purpose of This Funnel

The purpose of this funnel is **not** to collect data.

The purpose is to:

- Help the right visitor take the right next step
- Minimize confusion
- Match commitment level appropriately

This funnel should:

- Reduce decision fatigue
- Increase trust
- Route users to the correct path automatically
- Scale across different services and projects

---

## 2. Who This Funnel Is For

This funnel serves three primary visitor mindsets.

### Explorers
- Unsure what they need
- Just researching
- Low confidence, low urgency

### Evaluators
- Have a real problem
- Comparing options
- Need reassurance and clarity

### Buyers
- Clear intent
- Time-constrained
- Ready to act or commit

The funnel’s job is to **identify which one they are**, not ask them to choose.

---

## 3. Funnel Entry Philosophy (Critical Rule)

Visitors should never choose a form.  
The funnel should choose for them.

- Forms are tools
- Routing is guidance

---

## 4. Funnel Entry Page (Router Page)

### Page Goal
Help the visitor reach the correct next step in under 60 seconds.

### Core CTA (Primary)
**“Let’s figure out the best next step for your project.”**

### Supporting Microcopy
- Answer 4 quick questions
- No pressure. No obligation.
- You’ll get routed to the right option

---

## 5. Exact Routing Questions (Word for Word)

These questions are intentionally:
- Non-technical
- Low pressure
- Confidence-based

### Question 1: Intent
**What are you trying to do?**
- Build something new
- Improve or redesign an existing site
- Fix something that’s broken
- I’m not sure — I need guidance

### Question 2: Clarity
**How clear is your project right now?**
- Very clear — I know what I want
- Somewhat clear — I need help refining it
- Not clear — I need help figuring it out

### Question 3: Timing
**How soon do you want to start?**
- ASAP
- Within 2–4 weeks
- 1–3 months
- Just researching

### Question 4: Commitment Level
**What are you ready to do today?**
- Send a quick message
- Book a call
- Request a quote or proposal
- Do a full discovery intake

---

## 6. Routing Logic (Human-Readable Rules)

### Route to Quick Message when:
- “Just researching”  
  OR  
- “Send a quick message”

**Purpose:**  
Low-friction contact, curiosity capture, early trust.

---

### Route to Free Consultation when:
- “Not sure — need guidance”  
  OR  
- “Not clear”  
  OR  
- “Book a call”

**Purpose:**  
Clarify the problem, build trust, open an acknowledgment loop.

---

### Route to Project Quote when:
- “Very clear”  
  AND  
- “Request a quote or proposal”

**Purpose:**  
Serve prepared buyers without forcing a call.

---

### Route to Project Discovery when:
- “Somewhat clear”  
  AND  
- “Full discovery intake”  
  OR  
- Complex “build something new” signals

**Purpose:**  
De-risk high-complexity or high-value projects.

---

## 7. Result Screen Design (After Routing)

After the questions, show a **Result Page**, not an automatic redirect.

### Structure

#### Recommended Next Step (Primary)
- Large card
- Clear explanation of why this is recommended
- Single CTA button

#### Alternative Options (Secondary)
- One to two smaller options
- Reduced-friction escape paths
- Prevents bounce caused by “I don’t want that”

### Example Copy

**Recommended: Book a Free Consultation**  
Best if you’re still shaping the idea or want to talk it through.

Button: **Book a Free Consultation**

**Alternative: Request a Quote**  
Best if your scope is already defined and you want pricing.

Link: *I already know what I need →*

## 8. Funnel States (System-Level View)

This funnel feeds into a business lifecycle, not isolated pages.

### State A — Visitor
- Anonymous
- Browsing
- Learning

### State B — Identified Lead
- Contact info exists
- Message or form submitted

### State C — Engaged Conversation
- Consultation, booking, or active thread
- Trust building and qualification

### State D — Commitment
- Deposit, invoice, or agreement
- Clear project intent

### State E — Client / Project
- Delivery phase
- Communication, milestones, invoices

### State F — Support / Continuity
- Maintenance
- Retainers
- Tickets
- Repeat work

The funnel’s job is to move users cleanly from **State A → State C**.

---

## 9. Reusable Funnel Page Types

These page types should be reusable across all future services:

- Router page (entry)
- Quick message form
- Free consultation form
- Booking page
- Project quote form
- Project discovery intake
- Commitment or deposit page
- Confirmation / what-happens-next page

You already built most of these — now they’re intentional.

---

## 10. MVP vs Future Iteration

### MVP Focus
- Router
- One low-friction path
- One high-intent path
- One commitment checkpoint

### Future Enhancements
- Smarter routing logic
- Service-specific routers
- Paid discovery variants
- Retainer funnels
- Client-only flows

---

## 11. Guiding Principle

A good funnel reduces thinking, not choices.  
A great funnel replaces confusion with clarity.
