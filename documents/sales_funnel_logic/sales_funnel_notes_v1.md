# Sales Funnel Blueprint
## Strategic Logic and User Flows

---

## 1. User Psychology: The Three Personas

A successful funnel routes users differently based on their intent, even if they land on the same page.

### User Type A: The Explorer
- Mindset: Just browsing; low commitment
- Need: Clarity and understanding, not a sales pitch
- Goal: Leave with understanding and goodwill

### User Type B: The Evaluator
- Mindset: Has a real problem and is comparing options
- Need: Reassurance and professional validation
- Goal: Self-qualify without feeling under pressure

### User Type C: The Ready Buyer
- Mindset: Time-constrained and ready for action
- Need: A frictionless path to a solution
- Goal: Reach a confident next step quickly

## 2. The Four-Stage Funnel Framework

The fundamental rule is that the funnel should choose the form for the user, rather than making the user choose the form.

### Stage 1: Orientation
- Goal: Help users understand what kind of help they need
- Primary CTA: “Let’s figure out your next step”
- Constraint: No commitment and no pricing at this stage

### Stage 2: Self-Qualification

Ask a maximum of two to four routing questions:
- Do you already have a clear project scope?
- Is this a small website or a complex system?
- Are you ready to talk now, or just exploring?

### Stage 3: Routed Paths

Users are automatically directed to one of the following paths:

- Path A (Explorers)  
  Free Consultation  
  Page: free-consultation.html  
  Purpose: Build clarity and trust

- Path B (Prepared Buyers)  
  Project Quote  
  Page: project-quote.html  
  Purpose: Pricing and proposals

- Path C (Complex Projects)  
  Project Discovery  
  Page: project-discovery.html  
  Purpose: Deep alignment before pricing

### Stage 4: Commitment
- Action: Checkout or Deposit
- Page: checkout.html
- Condition: Only available after a consultation, quote review, or discovery session

## 3. Form Specifications and User Intent

Each form is designed to match the user's emotional state and decision readiness.

### Free Consultation
- Page: free-consultation.html
- Intent: Problem clarification
- User mindset: “I think I need help, but I’m not sure what yet”

### Consultation Booking
- Page: consultation-booking.html
- Intent: Commitment through scheduling
- User mindset: Ready to pick a specific time

### Project Quote
- Page: project-quote.html
- Intent: Request for proposal
- User mindset: Knows what they want and needs pricing

### Project Discovery
- Page: project-discovery.html
- Intent: High-stakes alignment workshop
- User mindset: Wants confidence before moving forward

### Checkout or Deposit
- Page: checkout.html
- Intent: Paid commitment
- User mindset: Trusts the provider and is ready to reserve a slot

## 4. Implementation Strategy

Before rebuilding, create a file named:

FUNNEL_USER_FLOW.md

This document defines the narrative logic of the funnel.

### Story-First Approach

Do not start with a flowchart. Start with a story:

I land here.  
I realize this is for people like me.  
I understand the process.  
I am offered a low-pressure next step.  
I feel confident taking it.

### Critical Success Questions
- Where do users hesitate or bail?
- What questions repeat?
- What is the lowest-risk next action?
  - Example: “Get clarity” instead of “Contact us”
